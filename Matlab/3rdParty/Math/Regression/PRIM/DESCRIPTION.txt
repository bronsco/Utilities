Description:
	The toolbox implements the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM),
	a method for finding “interesting” regions (bumps) in high-
	dimensional data. The regions are described by hyper-rectangles
	(boxes) containing simple decision rules. The toolbox can be used
	on regression-type as well as classification-type data. It accepts
	input variables to be continuous, binary, and categorical, as well
	as manages missing values.
	The source code is tested under Matlab version 8.5 (R2015a) and
	Octave version 4.0.0.

Installation (for Matlab):
	Copy the PRIM folder into the MATLAB_DIR/toolbox directory
	(where MATLAB_DIR indicates your Matlab installation directory).
	Start Matlab and select "Set path..." from the File menu. Click
	"Add folder..." button and select the folder
	MATLAB_DIR/toolbox/PRIM in the file dialog. Subsequently, press
	the Save button in order to save your changes to the Matlab
	search path. The toolbox is now installed. Have fun.
